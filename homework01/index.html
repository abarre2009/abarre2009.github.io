             <P>
            Hello My name is Abdul, I was born in East Africa and I migrated to the united states in 1997 at the age of 6. I went to school couple months after arriving in america and it was my first time around a people I did not understand what so ever.<br>
            learning new coding languages is much easier than learning english at a young age without much assistance.
            </P>
            <p>
            I really enjoy learning to code so far and don't get why people make it seem like its harder than learning anything else.<br>
            If you put in the neccessary hours outside of class and not be afraid to ask questions this class should be smooth.
             </p>
            <p>
                I look forward to all the awesome stuff I'm going to learn in the next 6 months.<br>
                I plan on having a personal side project of something to build on the side as a way to keep sharpning my coding skills.
            </p>
