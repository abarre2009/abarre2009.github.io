             <P>
            Hello My name is Abdul, I was born in East Africa and I migrated to the united states in 1997 at the age of 6.
            </P>
            <p>
            I really enjoy learning to code so far and don't get why people make it seem like its harder than learning anything else.
            </p>
            <p>
            If you put in the neccessary hours outside of class and not be afraid to ask questions this class should be smooth.
             </p>
